## Class Description

This course introduces students to statistical and computer science tools
and techniques commonly used in data driven astronomy and astrophysics.  It
does so through a hands-on approach, with theory followed by working through
examples of data analysis with modern astronomical datasets.  Practical data
analysis is done using Python tools, with emphasis on the astroML module
(see www.astroML.org).  The lectures taught at the undergraduate level,
designed for astronomy and physics majors.  The main discussion topics are
based on Chapters 4 and 5, and selected topics from Chapters 6-10, from the
reference textbook.
